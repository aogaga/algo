Adhoc Problems
==============

Supposedly the problems from this chapter will be the easiest of them all. Adhoc problems typically require no classic technique, but can sometimes be tedious.

Some of the topics touched in this chapter are:

* Card Games
* Chess
* Palindromes
* Anagrams
* Time
* 'Time Waster' Problems

There are others, but I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning them. Hope to move through this stuff quickly.
