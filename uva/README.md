uHunt/UVA Training 
==============

The plan for now is to work through all of the starred problems from Felix Halim's [Competitive Programming 3](http://cpbook.net/) material. A link to my account can be found [here](http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/id/355248).

The chapters will touch on

* Adhoc
* Data Structures
* Problem Solving Paradigms
* Graphs
* Mathematics
* String Processing
* (Computational) Geometry
* Mode Advanced Topics
* Rare Topics.

There are over 400 starred problems to be solved, so let's just see how it goes. :)
