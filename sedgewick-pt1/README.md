# Sedgewick's course on Coursera

Hoping to push through both part1 and part2 of Sedgewick's algorithm courses
on Coursera, which is mostly an intermediate survey course with Sophmores
and Juniors in mind. Somehow, it's still better, so far, than the single algo
course that was offered at my university. The topics covered in part 
one are

* union-find algorithms
* basic iterable data types (stack, queues, and bags)
* sorting algorithms (quicksort, mergesort, heapsort) and applications
* priority queues
* binary search trees
* red-black trees
* hash tables
* and symbol-table applications.


The topics that will be covered in part two (starts March/2016) are

* minimum spanning tree and shortest paths algorithms
* string processing algorithms, including string sorts, tries, substring search, regular expressions, and data compression
* overview placing the contents of the course in a larger context.
