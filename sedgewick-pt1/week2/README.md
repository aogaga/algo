The requirement in this programming assignment is to implement Deque and RandomizedQueue data structures from scratch. Took the approach of a doubly-linked list for Deque, for constant time add and remove operations. Still working on the RandomizedQueue. [Specification can be found here](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues.html)
