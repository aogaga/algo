USACO Training 
==============

This is part of an effort to improve my algorithm knowledge. I figure why not start with training in the same way kids
who want to get into the IOI do. Although these problems are typically meant for highschoolers, don't let the assumed
difficulty fool you.

The chapters will touch on

* Dynamic Programming
* Greedy
* Complete Search
* Flood Fill
* Shortest Path
* Recursive Search Techniques
* Minimum Spanning Tree
* Knapsack
* Computational Geometry
* Network Flow
* Eulerian Path
* Two-Dimensional Convex Hull
* BigNums
* Heuristic Search
* Approximate Search
* Ad Hoc Problems

Well here goes nothing. :)
